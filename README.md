### Forecasting Hospital Readmissions Using Machine Learning Models


### <ins> Problem Statement
The goal is to predict emergency department (ED) readmissions using a dataset containing patient information. The problem involves handling missing values, building predictive models, and evaluating their performance to identify the likelihood of readmission.

<ins> Methodology
1. Data Preparation and Handling Missing Values:

> Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure and identify missing values.  
> Address missing values through various strategies: imputation using mean, mode, zero values, and indicator variables for missingness.  
> Apply advanced imputation techniques (e.g., using the mice package) to fill in missing data based on relationships with other variables.  

2. Model Building and Evaluation:  

> Develop predictive models including logistic regression, LASSO logistic regression, classification trees (CART), and random forests.  
> Split the data into training and test sets to train and evaluate models.  
> Assess model performance using accuracy, ROC curves, confusion matrices, and variable importance to determine the best model for predicting readmissions.  
  
3. Incorporating Additional Features:  

> Enhance the models by integrating additional features derived from lab records.  
> Merge these features with the existing dataset and rebuild the models.  
> Re-evaluate model performance with the new features to assess improvements in prediction accuracy and overall model effectiveness.
