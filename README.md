### Forecasting Hospital Readmissions Using Machine Learning Models


### <ins> Problem Statement
The analysis aims to address two key objectives:

1. Visualize the Impact of Machine Learning Models: Illustrate how different machine learning models can be used to predict hospital readmissions and compare their effectiveness   
2. Classify Readmission Risk: Determine whether patients are at high risk of being readmitted to the hospital within a specified timeframe based on their medical history and other relevant features


### <ins> Methodology

• For Visualization: The project uses synthetic data to demonstrate how various machine learning models, including decision trees and ensemble methods, can be applied to predict readmission risk. The visualization highlights how these models manage complex, non-linear relationships in the data. 

• For Classification: The project utilizes a real-world hospital readmission dataset to build and evaluate multiple models—such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize each model's performance. The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve.
